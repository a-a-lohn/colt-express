# Milestone 2: Use Cases (Due: Oct 19) 

A use case model that describes the interactions between the system and the environment that take place when interacting with the game. 

The model covers all functionalities described in the official game manual as well as the additional project description handout document (i.e., including game lobby, game set up, loading and saving, etc.). It also covers how the game will interact with the provided lobby service.
