# Milestone 7: The Acceptance Test (22% of final grade / April 15 2021)

## Description
Ths is the last milestone! The customers (the group of graders) will test our game by controlling 3 of our devices/laptops/desktops to ensure all functionalities specified in the requirements are met.

## How the work is split up 
We decided to use a Excel spreadsheet to organize our work and think this spreadsheet allows us to see and to organize the our tasks better.
