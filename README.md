# Description
This project was created and developed over a period of about eight months for the course *COMP-361 - Software Engineering Project* at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/).

# Download and Installation
Download the latest release by clicking [here](https://github.com/a-a-lohn/colt-express/releases/download/v1.0/ColtExpress.Setup.Windows.x86.-.64.exe) and follow the installer instructions.

Please see the [setup guide](setup.md) for more details.
