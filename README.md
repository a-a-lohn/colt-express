# Description
This project was created and developed over a period of about eight months for the course *COMP-361 - Software Engineering Project* at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/).

# Download and Installation
Launch the Windows [executable](installer/ColtExpress Setup (Windows x86 - 64).exe) located in the `installer` folder.
Note: The executable is only compatible for Windows machines. Furthermore, this application relies on two external server components running on localhost: a [Lobby Service](https://github.com/kartoffelquadrat/LobbyService) (LS) instance and a [SmartFoxServer](https://www.smartfoxserver.com/) (SFS) instance. Please see the [setup](setup.md) guide for more details.

# Usage
Once downloaded/installed (or built manually), the game can be run by clicking on the Colt Express Unity Application executable.
