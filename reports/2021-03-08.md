## Status

### 3 most outstanding tasks scheduled until the next report, per team member
 * Frontend Team (Annie Ren, Insha Sohail) 
    * Attach choosecharacter strings to characters (attach character strings from
		 DisplayRemainingCharacters() to characters in the scene so that when the characters are clicked,
		 CharacterChoice(character) is called that passes the chosen character to the server. This
		 can be done by attaching scripts to each character game object, similar to how it will work for gameobjects on the game board)
	* Assign all gameobjects in dictionary upon update game state call
	* Implement prompt method in Gamemanager (i.e. set action and clickable global variables)
	* Write scripts attached to each game object that checks if it is clickable, if so, checks action and calls action on clicked item
	* Assign locations on game board to each gameobject (should be in attached scripts in as a global variable that is reassigned every time updategamestate() is called, checks updated gm instance for new item's position)


 * Networking Team (Aaron Lohner, Jules Niyonkuru, Faisal Rabbani)
   * Model + serialization/networking: server + client skeletal codebase (TouchCORE for Java server code), mark objects as serializable/transient, SFS calls to pass serialized objects (object STATE) between client and server (or passing entire game state), method listeners/handlers
    * More serialization 
    * More networking and testing 

* Backend Team (Jonathan Zhang, Hanaozhe Hu)

    * readyfornextmove / endofmove / endofcard
