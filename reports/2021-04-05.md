### Top 3 lessons learned since last report
   * Use git in this order: 
   * (1) PULL before you start working, 
   * (2) COMMIT your changes once you're done, 
   * (3) PULL again in case others made changes in the meantime, 
   * (4) RESOLVE MERGE CONFLICTS locally, (don't push anything before resolving merge conflicts first--this is the critical part), 
   * (5) PUSH

### 3 most critical bugs in current functionality (optional)
   * things related to playing an action card 
   * carrying out the specified action (update gameboard state)
