## Colt Express_Game Rules:

>**Components**:
	- the train(the train cars may have different looks/setups etc.)
	- extra little things(rocks, cactuses...)
	- each player is asigned one unique meeple that represents him/her in the game
	- each player has a set of cards(representing their actions)
	- each player may have one individual player board that outlines their character's abilities 
	- round cards (determine what happens during each round of the game)

Horizontal Rule 
>**Procedures**: 
	- player1 selects an action from his/her set of cards and puts that card onto a central pile 
	- player2 does the same ^
	- ...
	- start player selects thier second action...
	- ...(sometimes there are 3 rounds, sometimes 4) 
	- once all players have selected their actions, all actions are revealed and carried out(first-in-first-out)

>**Actions**:
	- [Climb] Climbing man with up and down arrows 
        -(allows you to move your token up onto the roof or back into the train car)
	- [Run] Running man with <-> 
        -(allows you to move one carriage to the left/right || move up to three carriages if on the roof)
	- [Rob] Man with $$ 
        -(allows you to tale any loot that happens to be in the same location you are)
	- [Punch] Man showing fist 
        -(allows you to punch another player who's in the same location you are). 
	    - After being punched, a player needs to move either one space to their left/right carriage and drop some $$ 
	- [Shoot] Man with gun 
        -(allows you to shoot a player who's in an *adjacent* carriage || shoot anyone happens to be on the roof if you are on the roof). 
	    - To shoot someone, you give them one of your bullet cards. More bullet cars -> less fewer actions that one can take 
	- [Moving the Marshal] the card that has a little sheriff's badge
        -(allows you to move the one who's controlling the train one carriage to the left/right)
	- If the marshal meets another player in the carriage -> that player is sent to the roof and that player receives a bullet card.
	- If a player who moves from the roof to the train car meets the marshal -> that player has to go back up onto the roof

>**Treasures**
	- Gems ($500 each)    
	- Money bags (ranging from $250 to $500)
	- The Strongbox (located in the front of the train, worth $1000) 

>**The Five Round Cards**
	- Describe how the actions are carried out
	- The action cards are played *face-up* onto the pile 
	- a tunnel: the player can play their action card facedown
	- two joint boxes: the player needs to play two action cards at once
	- event symbols on the upper right corner: i.e. 
		- everyone gets a bullet card 
		- all players on the roof get sent to the caboose
		- the marshal shoots all players on the roof above him 
		- ... 
		- we can elaborate on this!! 
	- after five rounds, the player that has the most $$ is the winner

>**Characters**
	- Each player has a special ability that will help him/her
	- [Ghost]: the mustache man 
		 - the first card that he plays in every round can be face-down 
	- [Cheyanne]: the umm Gypsy(?) girl 
		 - when she punches another player, she gets to take the moneybags(but not the gems) dropped by that player
	- [Gengo]: the brown boy who's in a suit 
		- for him the action of shooting someone => (shooting + punching)someone
	- [Belle]: the red-headed girl
		- she will never be chosen when another player needs to punch/shoot someone in her carriage
